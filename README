This repository contains R implementation of the algorithms proposed in "A Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithm for Survival Analysis with Application to Cancer Biology", which is appearing in the Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2019).

run_survival_random_forest_tcga.R shows how to replicate random forest experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_survival_svm_tcga.R shows how to replicate support vector machine experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_survival_group_lasso_mkl_tcga.R shows how to replicate group Lasso MKL experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_survival_group_lasso_mtmkl_tcga.R shows how to replicate group Lasso multitask MKL experiments on TCGA cohorts.
